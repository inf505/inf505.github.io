Some web games

[Scoundrel](https://inf505.github.io/scoundrel/)  is an actual game that uses a normal deck of playing cards. 

[Skeletonking](https://inf505.github.io/skeletonking/) is from an idea Scoundrel gave me... events, gear, monsters all coming from shuffled decks of cards.

[AIMD](https://inf505.github.io/aimd/frontend/) is a LLM assisted Medical Diagnosis game. Play as one of the 77 different specialities. (Some play better than others)
